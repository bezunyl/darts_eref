# Darts eRef (electronic referee)

This project serves as my first interaction with OCaml. My goal is to build an API-based front-end for keeping track of a game of darts, with its logic implemented in a functional paradigm. With the interface being API-based, it allows modularization and extensibility with other services (and acts as the visual part of a larger project I am working on).
